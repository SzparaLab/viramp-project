Setting up a EC2 instance
==========================

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/, in a Web browser.

Select 'My Account/Console' on the top right if you already have an account; otherwise sign up with a new account.

Go to the 'AWS Management Console' option, click the 'EC2' at upper left.

Before import the AMI, make sure you are in the right Availability zone. Amazon EC2 is hosted in multiple locations world-wide with multiple Availability zones, Resources cannot replicated across regions untill specified.  Our AMI is stored at region "US East(N. Virginia)". Check the upper right corner next to your account name, and make sure it's set at the right region. If not, just click and select the right one on the dropdown manual.

Click the blue button 'Launch Instance' at the mid-level of the page.

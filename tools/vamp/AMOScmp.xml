**What Reference-guided Scaffolding does**

Reference-guided Scaffolding is performed using AMOScmp, a comparative assembler that can assemble a set of shotgun reads from one organism using the orienting information from a related organism.  AMOScmp transforms the traditional overlap-layout-consensus approach to alignment-layout-consensus, which significantly increase the assembly efficiency.  The underlying mapping engine of AMOS is the MUMmer package, and then the layout step is designed to take into account any polymorphisms between the two genomes.

In our pipeline, this step uses contigs as input instead of shotgun sequences, to keep most variation out of the sequencing data.

**What to input**

At minimum, one FASTA file containing contigs from de novo assemblers and a reference genome in FATSA format is required.

An interleaved dataset of pair-end read information is also encouraged, because it will further help orient and bridge the contigs.
